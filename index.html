            <h2 style = "font-family: garamond; color: navy"> I LOVE BOOKS!!! </h2> 
            <h3 style = "background-color:black;font-family: garamond; color: orange"> This is the thing that I really love to do. To me, books are an escape out of my life and into the lives of others. It makes me feel less alone in the world I live in. It's also a good way to grow your vocabulary and great form of entertainment.</h3>

             <h3 style = "font-family: garamond; color: blue"> There are three projects that I are my favorites this year. Here are the links to them.<br><br>
                 <a href ="https://jackaby512.github.io/Vectors/" target = "_blank">Vectors</a>
                 <h3 style = "font-family: garamond; color: yellow"> I chose this one because of the effects and the changes that are made. And in general it's just awesome, too. <br><br>
                 <a href = "https://jackaby512.github.io/BouncyBall/" target = "_blank">Bouncy Balls</a>
                 <h3 style = "font-family: garamond; color: yellow"> This one is awesome because there's a lot of bouncy balls bouncing around! It's also kinda hard to keep up with, but that's what makes it awesome!<br><br>
                     <a href = "https://jackaby512.github.io/MyEmoji/" target = "_blank">My Emoji</a>
                     <h3 style = "font-family: garamond; color: yellow"> I chose this one because it's a lot of fun to look at. It's also cool when it refreshes and pops up in different spots and changes color. Also the eyeroll emoji ðŸ™„; who doesn't use that at all?
